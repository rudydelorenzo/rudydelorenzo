### Hi! I'm Rudy 👋

I'm a BSc student at U of A, full-time software engg, and part-time README writer 📝

I love trying out new technologies, so you'll find a bit of everything here. Technologies you can expect to find include:

* ⚛️ nodeJS + React full stack apps
* ⚙️ JavaScript CLI apps
* ☕ Java + JavaFX
* 🤖 Arduino (C++)
* 💾 PCB Designs
* 🌱 Python, PHP, and other misc. stuff

Take a look around and fork anything you find interesting! 🎉
